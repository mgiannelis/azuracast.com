# Install AzuraCast

AzuraCast is server-based software that is installed on a VPS, dedicated server or other computer and serves both your station broadcasts and its own web interface through the server's network connection.

## Ready-To-Go Installs

The easiest way to get started with AzuraCast is to create a new VPS with one of our supported partners:

- [DigitalOcean](digitalocean)
- [Linode](linode)

## Self-Installation

You can also install AzuraCast yourself on most server hardware and most computers running Linux.

Installing AzuraCast yourself requires a basic understanding of the Linux shell/terminal environment, as well as root (or "sudo") access to the computer you're installing AzuraCast on.

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

For a majority of users, our Docker installation method is the preferred way of installing and using AzuraCast:

 - [Self-Installation with Docker](docker)

### Other Installation Methods

Most servers and hosting providers support Docker without any issues. If your provider does not, or if you are using unique hardware, see the other guides below:

 - [Self-Installation for Raspberry Pi 3B/4](raspberry-pi)
 - [Self-Installation using Ansible](ansible)

I have followed these instructions and attempted every single installation method.
These instructions clearly do not work.
I have attempted every single intrucvtion set seperatly on clean Linux Ubuntu installs.
I know that this works. I had someone I used to call a friend install this for me on my self hosted Virtual Machine using Windows HyperV
Please. Would someone update the instruction set to more clear STEP BY STEP instructions.
I have tried everything I could think of. Even ran the instructions on a different machine.
These simply do not work.
The install also says depending on your internet speed that the who process should only take between 10 to 15 minutes.
The install (Once Finished With Constant errors) takes me over an hour on a 100Mbit Connection.
I also cannot find anyone or anywhere else to get any help with this.
I know that it should be working on my Dl360 server because it has been working before.
I cannot find any help, support or additional documentation to help install Azuracast anywhere.
Where is the support. Where can I find someone to help me?
The application simply will not run after installation! 
Please HELP 
Please email me matthew.giannelis@gmail.com.I am hoping to find someone who can SSH into a freash ununtu install and get this going for me again.
